# Flight-Delay-Prediction

This project consists of three modules:

1. Data Preprocessing ( module 1 )
2. Classification ( module 2 )
3. Regression ( module 3 )

The code has been split into many jupyter Notebooks:

1. Flight data merge
2. Weather data merge
3. flight - weather merge ( BEST MERGE FILE ) 
4. Classification has been done over UNDERSAMPLED, OVERSAMPLED, and NOSAMPLED data. 
5. Regression has been done over the OVERSAMPLED DATA ( as it was most suitable )
