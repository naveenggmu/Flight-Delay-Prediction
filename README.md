# Flight-Delay-Prediction

This project consists of three modules:

Data Preprocessing ( module 1 )
Classification ( module 2 )
Regression ( module 3 )

The code has been split into many jupyter Notebooks:

Flight data merge
Weather data merge
flight - weather merge ( BEST MERGE FILE ) 

Classification has been done over UNDERSAMPLED, OVERSAMPLED, and NOSAMPLED data. 
Regression has been done over the OVERSAMPLED DATA ( as it was most suitable )
